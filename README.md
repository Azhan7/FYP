								"How to install dependencies"

To install the dependencies first open the GBSSL_FYP folder

1) Move to Graph Learning folder
2) Run the following command on cmd or terminal 

	python setup.py install --user

All of the dependecies will be installed automatically


								                                                      "How to run SSL_Trails.py"

To run the trials/experiments

1) Open GBSSL_FYP folder
2) Move to Graph Learning folder
3) Move to examples
4) There you'll see ssl_trials.py folder run that file to perform different experiments.

								                                                "How to run trials on MNIST Dataset"
                                                                
                                                                
1) Open SSL_Trials.py file as described above
2) Open SSL_Trials.py and change dataset parameter on line 19 to 'MNIST'
3) Change metric dataset on line 20 to 'vae'
4) Move to line 27 and change dataset name to mnist
5) Algortihm list paramter on line 22 corresponds to the Algorithms you want to use to perform Graph based semi-supervised learning.

1) Open GBSSL_FYP folder
2) Move to Graph Learning folder
3) Move to examples
